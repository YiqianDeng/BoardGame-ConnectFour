Level of Game:
    - All features for level A and below level A

                        first (player object)
                        last (player object)
                        curr_player (player object)
                        board (board object)
                        signal_light (turtle object)
                        signal_text (turtle object)
                        info_box (turtle object)
                        piece (nested list of turtle object)
                        data (nested list of integer)
                        score (nested list)
                        scorefile (string)

    2.  Data Structure used:    Integers
                                Floats
                                Strings

                                Files


    3.  Non class functions defined:    create_turtle()
                                        who_turn()



Approach to testing:
    Basically I have test all attributes and methods for Player and Board.
    Also tested all attributes and as much as possible methods for Game.
    There are few graph and algorithm methods cannot be test in unittest, thus, I
    played as many as times with corner cases to make sure the game worked as expected.
    Corner cases include but not limited to following:
        1. create 3 * 4 board to test if the board full.
        2. default 6 * 7 board to test win vertical, horizontal, and 2 directions
            of diagonals.
        3. try to remove my pieces to make sure that I could only remove
            opponent's piece.
        4. try add piece to a column when this column is already full.
        5. try corner cases in both human vs computer and human vs human round
            several times to make sure it work well on both.
        6. create 12 * 18 board.
        7. test if no winner or with winner, score update successful.
